The game room is a gaming company that wanted to port their Android game over to a web-based game. The game is loosely similar to Win, Lose, or Draw where two teams play against each other and have to guess a picture that is loading from a large library of photos. I feel like I was able to decide what the design constraints of the project were as well as being able to interpret the domain model of the project. I think being able to decide what I was going to use before I started the project was the best thing about the design document. I was able to decide what parts were going to be difficult and what parts were not. The part that I would redo is the evaluation part of the design document. I think I could have found better information on each system if I would have search deeper. It is extremely important to interpret the user's needs because they are the ones that are hiring you to do the project. If you do not listen to what they want and instead go off on your own and design it how you want they most likely won't be happy with the final result. A technique that I would use is to decide what kind of application I am going to make before starting it. If I want to make a game what systems do I want it to run on and so forth? I usually approach designing software by breaking it into smaller parts and slowly building the program until I run into a problem and then I try and figure out how to fix it.
